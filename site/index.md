## About Me

Hi, how ya doin? I'm Pat.
I'm a software developer on the East Coast.

## Interests, hobbies, yadda yadda

I'm a big music fan, you can find a (relatively-comprehensive) list of bands / songs that I listen to here: [music](https://listenbrainz.org/user/huffstler).

Apart from listening to it, I also enjoy playing music. I've been playing the drums for 11 years now, though I'm self taught and have been out of practice for ~ 5 years.

I'm also getting into / out of the mechanical keyboard scene...

I currently have a [Glorious Modular Mechanical Keyboard](https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/gmmk-full-brown-switch), an [Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/), and an (as of now un-built) [Naked60](https://www.littlekeyboards.com/products/naked60bmp-keyboard-kit?variant=31348309426243), which rounds out my "Work - Home - Travel" collection.
