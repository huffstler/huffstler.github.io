<h1 id="welcome-to-my-first-blog-post">Welcome to my first blog
post</h1>
<p>Not much ado to be had, this wasn’t planned out in any way. I’ve been
putting off thinking about the types of topics I want to write about and
have been procrastinating pretty bad.</p>
<p>This is hopefully the kick I need to start getting my ideas “on
paper” so-to-speak.</p>
<p>I don’t have a plan for this blog currently, but I have a hazy idea
of where I’d like it to go. I don’t want it to be solely about one
topic, ideally it’d be a conglomeration of many short posts about a wide
variety of “things”. Those things could be food recipes, thoughts about
current events, new knowledge i’ve come across in life, shoot maybe even
some gaming gifs. Point is, I plan to share a range of things here, and
if it doesn’t do well…. that’s okay too.</p>
