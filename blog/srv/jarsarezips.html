<h1 id="jar-files-are-just-zips-and-how-vim-relates-to-that-thought">JAR
files are just ZIPs… and how VIM relates to that thought</h1>
<p>I honestly have no recollection of how I learned this first fact. I’m
sure it was while I was at my very first job out of college at a
regional bank. Java 7 was what we used, and Java 8 was the shiny new
thing. Every web-app ran on tomcat (no containers!!) with JSP’s as the
UI.</p>
<p>I remember my manager at the time helping me work through some issue
I was having, probably related to the fat-jar not finding the classes I
needed on the classpath. (Due to me borking the maven build
definition)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: How do I know where it’s looking to find the dependencies? Him:
Just open it up and look at the manifest. Me: What? Him: Yea, jar files
are basically just a zip file. You can change the extension and open it
in your file explorer. Rename it back to
<code>&lt;filename&gt;.jar</code> and you’re good to go. Me: Oh. Wow,
that’s cool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s been a nice little tidbit to have in the back of my head, been
rather helpful from time to time.</p>
<p>Oh, also Vim can open and navigate through ZIP files with the default
<code>zip.vim</code> plugin</p>
<p>I stumbled across <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/tx2and/today_i_learned_that_you_can_use_vim_to_interact/">this
reddit post</a> some time ago. This was a really nice find, as it
removed a couple steps that I usually took in order to look at or alter
data in zip files.</p>

<p>Can you see where this post headed?</p>
<p>Today at work, I had to do a bit of investigation. We have a cron job
running that’s not behaving and we don’t know why. The logging isn’t
helpful, it’s a large java project with haphazardly unstructured
classes, and the jar file name isn’t called anything that turned up in a
search through the source. So, how can little ol’ me find out what class
is actually being used when the jar is executed? VIM BABY.</p>

<p>Oh look, there’s the main class name. I wonder if I can search tha-
yup there’s what I needed!</p>
