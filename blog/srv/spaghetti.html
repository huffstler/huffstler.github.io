<blockquote>
<p>Measure with your heart, this isn’t baking!</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One bag of your preferred pasta. We like Linguine… But it’s your
life; Live it!</li>
<li>Tomato Sauce. How much you need depends on how many people you’re
cooking for / if you want leftovers. You can also crush some tomatoes
yourself if you’re looking for a slightly higher quality (and effort)
meal.</li>
<li>Tomato Paste. Combos nicely with the “fresher” sauce above.</li>
<li>Meat of your choice. We use mostly ground Deer at this point, but
ground Beef is a solid default. Beef won’t require much (if any) extra
fat to cook depending on your fat ratio, but Deer requires a heavier
hand with Olive Oil or butter or what have you.</li>
<li>Onion</li>
<li>Garlic</li>
<li>Cooking Oil
<ul>
<li>Olive Oil</li>
<li>Ghee</li>

<li>Spices (Go wild here, lots to discover!)
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard</strong>
<ul>
<li>Oregano</li>
<li>Basil</li>
<li>Garlic Powder</li>
<li>Onion Powder</li>
<li>Red Pepper Flakes</li>
<li>Cayenne Powder</li>

<h2 id="cooking-process">Cooking Process</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place">Mise en
Place</a></li>
<li>Preheat skillet on medium heat, at least 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Start heating up pot of water for pasta.</li>
<li>Sweat the chopped onions in the skillet, with whatever cooking oil
you’re using.</li>
<li>When they’re (Onions) almost done (to your preference) add the
minced garlic, and saute for another minute or so.</li>
<li>Remove onion and garlic from pan, keep in a bowl nearby.</li>
<li>Turn heat up to high for the skillet, wait another 2 to 3 minutes
for it to get to temp.</li>
<li>Place meat in the pre-heated skillet. My preference is to get a nice
brown on the meat. To do that you’ll want to keep the same side down in
the pan for a while.</li>
<li>Add pasta to preheated pot of water. Add good amount of salt, more
than you think is needed.</li>
<li>Once the meat is browned, break it up into a crumbly texture.</li>
<li>Remove meat from pan, let pan come back to temperature over
medium-high to high heat.</li>
<li>Once pan at temp, add tomato sauce to the pan.</li>
<li>Reduce tomato sauce slightly, half-to-full minute.</li>
<li>Add all other ingredients that you have on hand. (Including other
ingredients you previously cooked.)</li>
<li>Reduce the meat sauce to desired consistency while pasta cooks.</li>
<li>When pasta is done, reserve a cup or so of pasta water.</li>
<li>Strain pasta.</li>
<li>Add pasta water to meat sauce if you want a slightly thicker,
silkier sauce, or if you need to water it down. Don’t be afraid to add a
bunch of water, you can always reduce it down again.</li>
<li>Serve.</li>
