## Welcome to my first blog post.

Not much ado to be had, this wasn't planned out in any way. I've been putting off thinking about the types of topics I want to write about and have been procrastinating pretty bad.

This is hopefully the kick I need to start getting my ideas "on paper" so-to-speak.

I don't have a plan for this blog currently, but I have a hazy idea of where I'd like it to go. I don't want it to be solely about one topic, ideally it'd be a conglomeration of many short posts about a wide variety of "things". Those things could be food recipes, thoughts about current events, new knowledge i've come across in life, shoot maybe even some gaming gifs. Point is, I plan to share a range of things here, and if it doesn't do well.... that's okay too.
